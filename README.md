## Data Description
![#1589F0](https://via.placeholder.com/15/1589F0/000000?text=+)We obtained our data from the (MBTI) Myers-Briggs Personality Type Dataset from Kaggle. It provides the text of the 45-50 most recent social media posts for 8,600 users along with the userâ€™s MBTI personality type. 

>This gives us 422,845 total labeled points in the form (post text, MBTI type). The posts are drawn from the PersonalityCafe online forum, a platform for all kinds of >conversations and discussions, and they obtain the labels by allowing the user to input MBTI type as account info. Data in this dataset was collected from an Internet forum and >after analysing the content of the dataset. 

![#c5f015](https://via.placeholder.com/15/c5f015/000000?text=+)Non-uniform representation of MBTI types in the dataset that is not commensurate with the actual proportions of MBTI types in the general population was the most important reason for this. 

>It was determined that this is because the data was collected from an Internet forum created for discussion about personality type and MBTI types were repeated too many times in >the posts. This may also affect the accuracy of the model. As a result, NLTK was used to remove the MBTI types from the dataset.
